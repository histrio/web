If you, for some reason, want to grant me access to your server:

> `$ curl https://github.com/histrio.keys >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`

If you want to send me some encrypted stuff, use my public key:

> `$ curl -sSL https://github.com/histrio.gpg | gpg --import -`

Also I have some education in reserve-officer training department as a signaller and have a radio amateur license (CEPT NOVICE). So you could try to contact me with a morse code by calling `UB4RCF` :laughing:

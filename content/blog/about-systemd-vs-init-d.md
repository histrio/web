 I have no issues with a `systemd` and have no right or arguments or authority to criticize such a huge tool and all involved human efforts. It's a tool and it does its work. 

For my cases, it's an over-complicated tool though. I'd prefer to use a simple as is `init.d` when I need a simple thing working on a simple server. 

To go even further I'm considering moving my VPS to a FreeBSD. There is no tricky stuff there and it will fit my needs nicely and let me keep a simple environment at the same time.

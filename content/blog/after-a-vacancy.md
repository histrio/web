 I've spent almost two weeks without a laptop and very restricted mobile internet. When I sat at the keyboard again, there was no that excitement level as it used to be, even close. Maybe I'm just so tired after more or less hardcore trailing experience.

That place is a nice tool for writing by the way. It could be a neat tool to draft post ideas and tidy up formatting.  But such short posts should not exist as a blog post and it fits tweet format which is not my intention.

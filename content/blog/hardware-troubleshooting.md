 Another post to the "suffering journal". Experienced a lot of hardware fails:

- SSD disks become read-only or other IO errors
- Video card do not start while power on. Had to restart each time.
- Other system freezes of unknown origin.

It happened for a month, and I tried to replace SATA cables, disable "spoiled" disks, use the rest of the voodoo too. Started scaring myself with a shopping list if the motherboard broke. 

It was a power unit. No visible signs like an inflated capacitor or burn marks, though. Took a chance and bought a new PU. All problems are gone.

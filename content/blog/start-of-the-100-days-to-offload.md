 So, this will be my attempt to start and proceed with #100DaysToOffload. I'm not sure that I will have enough ideas or material to make really useful content and it could happen that there will appear posts like that: just random thoughts with not much sense.

My initial plan is to publish one post in 3 days and I think it is enough to come up with some idea and write not completely garbage text. Even this text takes more time than I expected but the process should improve soon.

Also, I believe, that it would be a good enough way to practice English writing skills. There will be not so many readers of that to be offended by its grammar or style. I'm still using [grammarly](https://grammarly.com) just to be sure that there is no obvious misspelling and stuff. If you have any comments though, I will be glad to hear them.

My previous posts here are pretty crappy and contain only some code snippets. I've not decided yet, will be they rewritten as a new post, which could be considered as cheating, or just edited. Also, there is a question about how to store snippets. Right now it is built-in as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) but maybe it will be better to move into the post as `code` block.

Wish me persistence and stubbornness.

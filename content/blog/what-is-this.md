 Another platform and another attempt to begin to write something. I will try to migrate here some older posts (not all though) in time. Or, maybe it will became not so technical place and will contain some thoughts, but I'm afraid which I have not much. Will it be a topics with a vote idea or just a public journal? Will I convert posts from to the `gemini` mirror?

Did not write a line of code for a week. And it didn't happen since school, I think. Nothing. No urgent need to go back to the keyboard, so far.
